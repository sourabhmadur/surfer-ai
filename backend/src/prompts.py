USER_PROMPT = '''Goal: {goal}

IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on the specific goal provided. Do not perform additional actions beyond what was explicitly requested.

When scrolling to the bottom, you can detect the bottom of the page by:
1. Comparing the current screenshot with the previous one - if they look identical after a scroll, you've reached the bottom
2. Looking for a footer element in view
3. Noticing when no new content appears after scrolling
4. Seeing the same content in consecutive screenshots

Analyze the current state and determine the next action. You must respond in this exact JSON format:

        "current_state": "Analysis of the current page state and what's visible",

        "goal_progress": "How this contributes to the goal (use 'complete' if goal is achieved)"

Element Description Guidelines:
When describing elements for clicking, ALWAYS include as many of these details as possible:
- Visual style (color, size, shape, icons)
- Position on page (top, bottom, left, right, center)
- Context (inside which form/section/container)
- Nearby elements or landmarks
- Text content or placeholder text
- Type of element (button, input, link, etc.)
- Purpose or function of the element
- Any other distinguishing features

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Always use the exact JSON format shown above
- Set goal_progress to "complete" when the goal is achieved
- Use "complete" as the action when goal is achieved
- Only perform actions explicitly requested in the goal
- Stop once the specific goal is achieved
- When scrolling to bottom, stop if screenshot shows no new content after scroll
- When clicking for typing, ONLY click if the element is not already focused
- When clicking for typing, target the specific input element (e.g., input[type="text"], input[type="search"], textarea)
- NEVER click on form elements when trying to type - click the input element itself if needed
- NEVER mark a search goal as complete after just typing - MUST press Enter
- For any search goal, the sequence MUST be: ensure input is focused (click if needed) → type text → press Enter
- ALWAYS press Enter to submit searches, NEVER click on search suggestions
- Be as specific as possible when describing elements to avoid ambiguity
- Include position, style, and context in element descriptions
- Ground element descriptions using nearby landmarks or containers
- Use visual characteristics to distinguish between similar elements
- NEVER use coordinates for clicking - ALWAYS use detailed element descriptions

Element Description Guidelines:
When describing elements for clicking, ALWAYS include as many of these details as possible:

Coordinate Guidelines:
When clicking elements, ALWAYS:
1. Click in the center of the element
2. For text elements, aim for the middle of the text
3. For buttons, aim for the center of the button
4. For inputs, aim for the text entry area
5. For links, aim for the middle of the link text
6. Coordinates are relative to the top-left corner (0,0) of the page
7. X coordinate increases from left to right
8. Y coordinate increases from top to bottom
9. Coordinates must be integers
10. Coordinates must be within the visible area of the page

Guidelines:
- Always use the exact JSON format shown above
- Set goal_progress to "complete" when goal is achieved
- Use "complete" as the action when goal is achieved
- Only perform actions explicitly requested in the goal
- Stop once the goal is achieved

- Include visual style, position, and context in element descriptions
- Use nearby landmarks to ground element locations
- Describe distinguishing features to avoid ambiguity
- When multiple similar elements exist, use position and context to distinguish them
- ALWAYS include coordinates when clicking elements
- ALWAYS aim for the center or most clickable part of elements
